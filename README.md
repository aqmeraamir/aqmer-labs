# Aqmer Labs - Interactive Physics & Stats Tools

I built Aqmer-Labs as a collection of my interactive web simulators including a physics collisions simulator, a correlation visualiser, and a small game, bundled as a single 
React-based site. Each tools was inspired by the topics I learnt in my A-Level lessons and I wanted to visualise them using code. The repo is deployed using Vercel and can be accessed, live, on:
https://aqmer-labs.vercel.app

## Features

# Collisions physics simulator - interactive, real-time 2D collisions (elastic/inelastic demos, can enable gravity/vectors/trails).

# Correlation visualiser - scatterplot + regression tools to explore correlation and relationships.

# Small interactive game - radnomly generated hypothesis testing questions on product moment coorelation coefficient

## Setup (to run locally)

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aqmeraamir/chess-bot.git
   cd chess-bot
   ```

2. Install dependencies
    ```
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```


3. Start the server
    ```
